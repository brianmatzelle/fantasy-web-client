DYNAMIC MEMORIES are a two-memory system for tracking evolving projects/analyses. When a user says "create a dynamic memory about XYZ", follow this pattern:

**STEP 1: Create the STATE memory**
- Title: "[Project Name] - Current State" 
- Content: The actual data/findings/progress in structured format
- Include: current status, key findings, progress made, next steps, important details
- Use clear sections with headers like "COMPLETED AREAS:", "KEY FINDINGS:", "CURRENT STATUS:"

**STEP 2: Create the POINTER memory** 
- Title: "[Project Name] - Dynamic Memory Pointer"
- Content: "This is a pointer to the dynamic [project] memory. When working on [project], ALWAYS read and update the '[Project Name] - Current State' memory to maintain current progress and findings. The state memory contains [brief description of what's stored]. Update it whenever [specific trigger for updates]."

**PURPOSE:** The pointer memory ensures I remember to check and update the state memory in future sessions, maintaining continuity across conversations.

**EXAMPLE PATTERN:**
State: "Fantasy-MCP Development - Current State" (contains actual progress/code/findings)
Pointer: "Fantasy-MCP Development - Dynamic Memory Pointer" (reminds me to use the state memory)

**WHEN TO USE:** For any ongoing project, analysis, or development work that spans multiple sessions and needs progress tracking.
